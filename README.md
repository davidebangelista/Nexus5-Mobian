# Nexus5-Mobian
A repo to port the nexus 5 to mobian. 

The mobain rootfs has been built. Now work is being done on:
- GPU:n
- CPU: p
- Wi-Fi: n
- BT: n
- Modem: n

n = not working.
p = partial
y = yes

I only have the base as only cpu rendering is avalible at the moment.

You'll find a config for kernel 5.16. Firmware and drivers are an issue i'm trying to fix.

I'm using the stock 5.16 kernel as pmos kernel isn't found.
